Identifying and understanding human activity patterns are essential for effective resource management and urban planning. However, due to limitations in data precision, few studies have focused on extracting human activity patterns at high spatiotemporal resolutions. In this study, we utilized Tencent Location Request (TLR) data to analyze human activity patterns across different temporal scales in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We constructed TLR time series on intra-day and annual scales and applied various clustering algorithms to evaluate their effectiveness. Post-clustering, we observed significant differences in land use types, trajectory data, and check-in data counts among the identified patterns. Based on these activity characteristics, we classified daily patterns into three main types: daily, mobility, and dispersed residential patterns. Annual patterns were classified into two types: urban and rural patterns. Our results indicate that over 80% of location data in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau correspond to daily patterns, with a similar distribution between urban and rural patterns in annual data. This study demonstrates that location request data can effectively extract human activity patterns, thereby enhancing the spatiotemporal resolution of activity research in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
